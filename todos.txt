TODOS:
get partial order of threads (exe order)
write to file (info of the target program)
read from file (exe order)

?shuffle
?channel (complicates shuffle)
?insert probe at end of closure main (threaded)

============================

CONFLICT:
translate probe.c to probe.rs 
	--> the name of function changes. ex: __init__ to _ZN9...__init__

=============================

DONE:
semaphore at spawn and spawned
