TODOS:
seperate traffic light probe and random sleep probe (pc counter)
rse mut detect the crash of the target program

insert probe at end of closure main (threaded)
get partial order of threads (exe order)
handle channel (complicates shuffle)

============================

CONFLICT:

=============================

DONE:
semaphore at spawn and spawned
translate probe.c to probe.rs 
	--> the function name still remain unresolved
write to file (info of the target program)
read from file (exe order)

=============================

WONT DO:
shuffle
